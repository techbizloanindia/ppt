    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured as a tabbed interface, which is a classic and highly intuitive SPA pattern. The navigation bar allows users to select "Week 1", "Week 2", "Week 3", "Week 4", or "Overview & Next Steps". This segmentation immediately breaks the dense 30-day plan into manageable, thematic sections, directly addressing the "easily consumable" goal. Each "Week" tab displays a grid of 7 "day cards". Each card is interactive, acting as an accordion: clicking its header toggles the visibility of the detailed "concepts" and "task" for that day. This "summary + details on demand" interaction prevents overwhelming the user and is excellent for mobile. The "Overview" tab provides high-level synthesis: a Chart.js doughnut chart visualizes the distribution of topics (Fundamentals, OOP, etc.), and the "What's Next?" section is presented as a series of clear, visual cards. This structure was chosen over a single scrolling page to promote focused exploration (one week at a time) and to add analytical value (the chart). -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info -> Goal -> Viz/Presentation Method -> Interaction -> Justification -> Library/Method. 1. Daily Plan (Days 1-30): Goal: Inform & Organize. Method: Interactive Accordion Cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction: Click to expand/collapse card body. Justification: Prevents information overload, mobile-friendly, allows users to scan the week's topics. 2. Topic Distribution (Analysis of all 30 days): Goal: Synthesize & Analyze. Method: Doughnut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Hover for tooltips. Justification: Provides a high-level summary of the plan's focus (e.g., "X% is Fundamentals"), adding analytical value not present in the original report. 3. Specialization Paths: Goal: Inform (Future Steps). Method: Static Visual Cards (HTML/CSS). Interaction: None (static content). Justification: More visually engaging and separated than the original report's bullet list. - CONFIRMING NO SVG/Mermaid, supporting the tabbed structure. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-700 mb-6">Week 1: Python Fundamentals (The Essentials)</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-6">This first week is all about setting up your environment, understanding Python’s basic syntax, and establishing a **foundation for problem-solving**. You’ll learn how to store information using variables and data structures, and how to control the flow of your program using conditionals and loops. By the end of this week, you'll be able to write small, self-contained, functional programs.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-stone-700 mb-6">Week 2: Intermediate Concepts (Structure & Data Management)</h2>
                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-6">Now that you have the basic syntax down, Week 2 shifts focus to **code reusability and managing larger data sets**. You'll master dictionaries for storing complex relationships and the crucial skill of writing **functions** to organize and modularize your code. You'll also learn the fundamental skill of **File Input/Output (I/O)**, which allows your programs to interact with the external world and save persistent data.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-6">This week, you'll level up to writing more efficient and **"Pythonic" code**, making you faster and your code cleaner. You’ll cover crucial topics like **Error Handling** (making your programs robust against failure) and **Modules** (importing tools written by others). Finally, you’ll learn specific, real-world utility tasks, such as working with dates and powerful text pattern matching using Regular Expressions.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 mb-6">The final week introduces you to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, the professional paradigm for building scalable, complex applications. You'll shift your thinking from a sequence of steps to designing **system architectures**. You'll also integrate core third-party tools like the `requests` library for **APIs** and the **Pandas** library for data analysis, preparing you directly for your chosen specialist track.</p>
